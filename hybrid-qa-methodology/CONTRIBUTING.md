# Contributing

You want to improve this workflow? Good. Follow the rules.

1. **Fork & PR**  
   - Branch: `chore/docs-{topic}`  
   - Keep commits atomic.

2. **Stay Tactical**  
   - No fluff, no buzzwords.  
   - Every addition must educate, not decorate.

3. **Align with Philosophy**  
   - Agile + Shift‑Left + Risk‑Based.  
   - If your change breaks that triad, explain why.

4. **Update Docs**  
   - Touching the flow? Update diagrams/checklists.

5. **License**  
   - MIT. Same as the rest of the repo.
