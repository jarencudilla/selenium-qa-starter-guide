# Hybrid QA Methodology

We don’t idolize methodologies; we weaponize them.

This documentation captures the real-world QA system used at **QA Journey**—a hybrid that fuses Agile collaboration, Shift‑Left timing, and Risk‑Based focus.

Use it, fork it, adapt it. Just don’t file it away and forget it.
